# Neighborhood Map Application
It's a web application, built using the ReactJS, to display Google Map of the best places to visit in Luxor, Egypt. The application implements use of responsive web design, accessibility through use of ARIA roles and labels, as well as a service worker for offline access of the app.

## Getting Started
Run:
```
npm install
```
and then
```
npm start
```
now open your browser on [`localhost:3000`](#localhost:3000)

## Working Offline

In order to have a working service worker, the app must run in production mode. Build the app by running `npm run build` and run it on a local server by using serve `-s build` and opening your browser at `http://localhost:5000` or deploy it to a specific address of your choice.
